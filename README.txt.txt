Bluetooth Signal Strength Relay Controller
Overview
This project implements a Bluetooth signal strength-based relay controller using an ARTY S7 FPGA, HC-05 Bluetooth module, and an IOT relay. The system monitors the signal strength (RSSI) from a paired Bluetooth device and toggles a 12V power supply based on proximity.
